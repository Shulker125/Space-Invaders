# Space-Invaders


> This project implements arrays, classes, and methods to create a Space Invaders type game. The main class was the Frame class that calls all other classes and methods to run the program. 

## How to Play

> To begin, select a difficulty by pressing either 1, 2, or 3 on your keyboard. Use the WASD or arrow keys to control the ship and space to fire. The objective of this game is to clear the screen of all the aliens while avoiding all the enemy bombs, and once that is complete, you will level up. As you progress, the amount of time you have to complete each level decreases.

#### The first if statement checks if the time has run out in the game. If it isn't it changes the time by one second and if it is it ends the game. The second if statement checks if the stage has been cleared so that it can deisplay the next stage.
